## Reflection on The Gaming Room Project

**Client and Requirements**  
The Gaming Room was a client seeking to expand their existing game, *Draw It or Lose It*, into a cross-platform software application. Their requirements included supporting multiple teams and players, ensuring scalability, and maintaining consistent game state across different operating systems. The design needed to be efficient, secure, and adaptable to future growth.

**Strengths in Documentation**  
One area I did particularly well was clearly organizing the design document to communicate technical details in a way that was accessible to both developers and non-technical stakeholders. I provided structured sections that outlined requirements, constraints, and platform considerations, which made the document easy to follow.

**Helpful Aspects of the Design Process**  
Working through the design document forced me to think critically about architecture before writing code. This helped me anticipate challenges, such as concurrency and resource management, and gave me a roadmap that made actual development smoother.

**Potential Revisions**  
If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the section on scalability. While I addressed it conceptually, I could improve by including more detailed examples of load balancing or distributed system strategies to strengthen the design.

**Interpreting User Needs**  
I interpreted the client’s needs by focusing on usability and reliability. For example, ensuring that game state was synchronized across platforms directly reflected the user’s requirement for fairness and consistency. Considering user needs is critical because software ultimately succeeds only if it solves the problems and delivers the experience users expect.

**Approach to Software Design**  
My approach combined requirement analysis, platform comparison, and modular design strategies. I used abstraction to separate concerns and UML diagrams to visualize system interactions. In the future, I would continue using these techniques, while also incorporating iterative prototyping to validate design decisions earlier in the process.
